# Turing machines simulator and emulator

This project consists of coding a Turing machine code reader and emulator.


The project also allow the usage of different languages for the machine, e.g. {0,1}, {a,b,c,d}, ...etc\
It allows also the usage of a semi-finite memory or an unbounded memory.

Lastly, we coded a feature that allows to read a Turing machine code of a certain language or memory -say {a,b,c,d} and semi finite-\
and then gives another **equivalent code** of another langage, say {0,1} and unbounded.
